# travel-stackexchange

This repo contains an analysis of a travel stackexchange .xml data dump and includes the following steps:

* Converting raw xml to a MySQL database schema
* Data cleaning - working with xml and html
* Data exploration - asking data questions and visualizing results
* Model building including classification and regression

All steps have been modularized for reproducability on any of the 350 stackexchange forum data dumps. Classes are found in the .py files.
